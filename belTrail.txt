game start
To start off, where would you like to begin your journey?
Stanwood
Seatle
Yelm
Ah, going for the tiny town of Stanwood are we?  Very... interesting place, that one.
The Emerald City!  I don't check in with the Seahawks much these days, but I do hope they're getting plenty of home runs!
Yelm?  That's somewhere near Olympia, right?
I don't think I've heard of that one.
